# AppTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.11.

## Backend API prerequisites

The application expects a backend server exposing the following endpoints:

- `POST /auth/login` – validates credentials and returns a JWT token.
- `POST /auth/logout` – clears the user session using the provided token.
- `GET /menus` – returns the menu tree for a company. The `owner_id` query
  parameter selects the company, e.g. `/menus?owner_id=1`.

All endpoints are assumed to live under the base URL configured via the
Angular environment files (see next section).

## Accessory endpoints

The following routes are used in `AccesoriosComponent` for creating and
updating accessories and their materials/components:

- `POST /accessories`
- `PUT /accessories/:id`
- `POST /accessory-materials`
- `PUT /accessory-materials/:id`
- `POST /accessory-components`
- `DELETE /accessory-components/:id`

When an accessory is saved, the backend must calculate and persist
`cost`, `price` and `profit_percentage` so that the frontend does not have
to compute them. The endpoints `GET /accessories` and
`GET /accessories/:id` should return these stored values.

## Configuring the API base URL

Open the existing `src/environments/environment.ts` file (generated by the CLI) and ensure it contains:
```ts
export const environment = {
  apiUrl: "http://localhost:3000"
};
```

For production builds you can add `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` with an
 appropriate value and update `angular.json` to replace the file during `--prod`
builds. Import `environment` from `src/environments/environment` in your services
to prefix all backend requests with `environment.apiUrl`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). This internally runs `npx ng test`.

## Useful commands

- `npm start` - serves the application using Angular CLI (`ng serve`).
- `npm test`  - runs unit tests with Karma.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
